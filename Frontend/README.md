## Also — Still Seeing Empty Commits
```
commit --quiet --allow-empty-message
```

This is still happening. Please start typing messages in VS Code before every commit. Even something simple like:
```
docs: add Frontend README
```

---

## Current Status
```
✅ Repo recognized and connected to GitHub
✅ .gitattributes working
✅ Frontend/README.md file exists
⚠️  Frontend/README.md is empty → write content now
⚠️  Backend/README.md probably also empty → write that too
⚠️  Commit messages still blank → fix this habit
⏳ Still need to push latest commits
⏳ Still need to update Render
